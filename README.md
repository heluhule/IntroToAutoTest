# Introduction to Automation Testing 

Welcome to the Introduction to Automation Testing session 0_0!

In this session, we've covered all the content for today, and now it's time for you to get used to automation testing by solving a problem. This repository includes two Python files: `finding.py` and `checking.py`.


### Problem Statement: Finding the Second Biggest Number in a Matrix

The task is to implement a simple algorithm to find the **Second Biggest Number** in a matrix. Let's go through both Python files to ensure that all the test cases pass successfully.

#### File Descriptions:

- **finding.py**: Contains the implementation of the algorithm to find the Second Biggest Number in a matrix.

- **checking.py**: Used for checking and running test cases against the implemented algorithm.

## Good Luck! 

For those who do not have pytest yet just simply install by:
- pip install pytest
